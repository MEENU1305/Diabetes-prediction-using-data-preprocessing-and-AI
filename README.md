Data Preparation 
FEATURE ENGINEERING & DATA PRE-PROCESSING

Feature engineering and Data Pre-Processing are the most significant topics in data science. In a general opinion, %80 of the work is data preprocessing, and %20 of the work is modeling in a machine learning project, therefore, there are issues to be considered. The aim of this notebook is to be a tutorial on the approach to data preparation.

First of all, check the what is the difference between feature engineering and data preprocessing.

Feature Engineering: The work performed on the features (such as preprocessing, generating a new variable, etc.), and generating variables from raw data.

Data Preprocessing: The process of making the data suitable before implementing a model.
