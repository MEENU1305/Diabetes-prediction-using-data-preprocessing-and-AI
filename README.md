Data Preparation 


FEATURE ENGINEERING & DATA PRE-PROCESSING

Feature engineering and Data Pre-Processing are the most significant topics in data science. In a general opinion, %80 of the work is data preprocessing, and %20 of the work is modeling in a machine learning project, therefore, there are issues to be considered. The aim of this notebook is to be a tutorial on the approach to data preparation.



Feature Engineering: The work performed on the features (such as preprocessing, generating a new variable, etc.), and generating variables from raw data.

Data Preprocessing: The process of making the data suitable before implementing a model.

In this step, there are 4 topics to consider and handle to prepare the dataset.

Outliers
Missing Values
Feature Extraction
Encoding & Scaling
All of these are the steps of data preprocessing and feature engineering, and each of them will be explained in the notebook.

Obviously, before the process, the dataset has to be explored, and the variables have to be understood. That means the dataset has to be prepared before preparing. Make ready to your popcorns for the movie named "Inception on Data Science"! Of course, it does not that hard, but there are rules and steps to be followed in order to not get lost.
